name: U-FLOW

description: "U-Flow is a probabilistic anomaly detection algorithm that combines a U-shaped architecture with normalizing flows to model the distribution of multi-scale image features. It computes dense likelihood maps to localize anomalies and applies statistical post-processing to produce precise segmentation masks. The model is fully unsupervised and effective for fine-grained industrial inspection tasks."
