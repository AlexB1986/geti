name: STFPM

description: "STFPM uses a studentâ€“teacher architecture with multi-scale feature pyramid matching: during training, student features are aligned with teacher outputs across layers; discrepancies at test time highlight anomalies. Due to such operations, this approach achieves accurate and fast pixel-level anomaly detection."
